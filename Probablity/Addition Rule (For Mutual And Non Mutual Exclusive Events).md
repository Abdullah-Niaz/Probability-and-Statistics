# Probablity

1. Introduction
2. Addition Rule ( for mutually exclusive events)
3. Addition Rule ( for non mutually exclusive events)
4. Multiplication Rule ( Independent & Dependent Events)

## Probablity:

It is about the determing the likelihood of an event/experiment.

**EX: Toss a coin {H,T}**
Pr(H) => 1 / 2 => 50%
Pr(T) => 1 / 2 => 50%

**Rolling a Dice {1,2,3,4,5,6}**
Pr(x=1) => 1 / 6 => 0.16%

## Mutual Exclusive Event:

Two Evenets are mutual exclusive if they can't occur at the same time.

**Ex: Tossing a Coin {H,T}**
You may either get head or tail. Both two can't occur at the same time.

Pr(H or T) = > Pr(H) + Pr(T) (Additive Rule for mutual Exclusive event)
=> 1/2 + 1/2 => 2/2 => 1

**Rulling a Dice {1,2,3,4,5,6,}**
Pr(1 or 5) = Pr(1) + Pr(5)
=> 1 / 6 + 1 / 6 => 2 / 6 => 3

## Non Mutual Exclusive Event:

Two Evenets are non mutual exclusive if they can occur at the same time.

This guide provides the formula for calculating the probability of picking a specific card (or duck) labeled "K" from a collection of cards.

To calculate the probability, you need two key values:

- **Total Number of Cards (N):** The total cards or items in the collection.
- **Number of Cards with "K" (k):** The specific count of cards labeled "K."

The probability \( P \) of drawing a card labeled "K" is given by:

P(picking K) = k/N

Assume:

- You have a total of 52 cards in a standard deck,
- Out of these, 4 cards are labeled "K" (e.g., the four kings in a deck).

Then:

P(picking K) = 4/52 => 1/13 ~ 0.0769% or 7.69%

Thus, the probability of drawing a "K" card from a standard deck is approximately **7.69%**.

**if P(picking K, Picking heart) = k / N + heat / N**
=> 4 / 52 + 13 / 52 => 17 / 52 => 0.325% or 32.5%
