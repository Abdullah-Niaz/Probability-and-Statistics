The geometric distribution models the number of trials until the first success in a sequence of independent trials (e.g., flipping a coin until you get heads). This distribution is discrete.
    PMF: Probability of the number of trials to the first success.
    CDF: Cumulative probability of achieving success within a certain number of trials.
