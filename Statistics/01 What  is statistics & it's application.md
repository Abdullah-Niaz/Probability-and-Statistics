## Decision Making with Statistics

### Example Data Set:

    Age = {24, 27, 12, 13, 29, 32, 33, 46}

### Statistical Measures:

**1. Mean (Average)** – Provides a central value for the dataset.

**2. Median** – The middle value when the data is arranged in order.

**3. Mode** – The most frequently occurring value.

These measures help summarize and understand data trends, which are essential for making decisions.

### Data Visualization Tools

To understand data trends, graphical tools are commonly used:

**1. Histogram:** Visual representation of the frequency distribution of a dataset.

**2. PDF (Probability Density Function):** Shows the probability distribution of continuous variables.

**3. CDF (Cumulative Density Function):** Represents the probability that a variable takes a value less than or equal to a certain threshold.

These charts and graphs provide visual insights into data, making it easier to interpret patterns and distributions.

### Example: COVID-19 Data Analysis

During the COVID-19 pandemic, statistical analysis was critical in understanding and combating the virus. Key questions answered through statistics included:

- How many people are infected?
- How many people have recovered?
- How many deaths have occurred?
- How many people are vaccinated?
- What are the infection and recovery rates in specific regions?

These insights allowed governments and healthcare organizations to make data-driven decisions on public health policies and safety measures.
