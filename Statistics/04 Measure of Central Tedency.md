# Measures of Central Tendency

**Measures of central tendency** are statistical tools used to summarize a set of data by identifying the central point within that data set. The three most common measures of central tendency are the **mean**, **median**, and **mode**.

## 1. Mean

The **mean** (or average) is calculated by adding up all the values in a data set and dividing by the number of values.

### Formula:

Mean = Sum of all values / Number of values
​

### Example:

For the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 10, 12

Mean = 4 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 12 / 5 = 8.4

### Characteristics:

- The mean is **sensitive to outliers**, meaning very high or very low values can significantly affect the mean.
- The mean is useful for data that is symmetrically distributed without extreme values.

## 2. Median

The **median** is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in ascending order. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle one. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

### Example:

- For an odd number of values: Data set: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 → Median = 7.
- For an even number of values: Data set: 3, 5, 7, 8 → Median = (5 + 7) / 2 = 6.

### Characteristics:

- The median is **not affected** by outliers, making it a better measure for skewed distributions.
- It represents the point where 50% of the data is below and 50% is above.

## 3. Mode

The **mode** is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set. A data set can have one mode, more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all.

### Example:

- For the data set: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 → Mode = 2.
- For the data set: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3 → Modes = 1 and 2 (bimodal).
- For the data set: 1, 2, 3, 4 → No mode (as all values occur only once).

### Characteristics:

- The mode is particularly useful in **categorical data**, where we want to know the most common category or value.
- In numerical data, it highlights the most frequent value but does not necessarily indicate the central tendency of the entire data set.

## When to Use Each Measure

| Measure    | Best Used For                            | Sensitive to Outliers? |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Mean**   | Symmetrical data without outliers        | Yes                    |
| **Median** | Skewed data or when outliers are present | No                     |
| **Mode**   | Categorical or nominal data              | No                     |

## Conclusion

Each measure of central tendency—**mean**, **median**, and **mode**—provides different insights into the distribution of data. The choice of which measure to use depends on the nature of the data and the specific analysis goals. In many cases, using all three measures together can offer a more comprehensive understanding of the data set.
