# Types of Statistics:

    1. Descriptive Statistics
    2. Inferential Statistics

## 1. Descriptive Statistics:

Descriptive statistics involves methods for summarizing and organizing data to provide an overview. It focuses on presenting the data through numerical summaries, graphs, and charts. Descriptive statistics help simplify large amounts of data in a sensible way.

### Key Concepts:

- **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **Measures of Dispersion:** Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- **Data Distribution:** Frequency distributions, Percentages, Graphical representations (like histograms, bar charts, pie charts,)

**Example:** If you survey a group of students and record their exam scores, descriptive statistics would be used to calculate the average score (mean) and present it in a graph.

## Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics involves using a sample of data to make inferences or predictions about a larger population. It allows us to make conclusions that extend beyond the immediate data alone. This type of statistics is used to make decisions, predictions, and generalizations about a population from a sample. (Using some Experiments: Z-Text, T-Text)

**Based one:** Population & Sample

### Key Concepts:

- Hypothesis Testing
- Confidence Intervals
- Regression Analysis
- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- Sampling Methods

**Example:** From a sample of 100 people, inferential statistics could be used to estimate the average height of the entire population of a city, or test whether there is a significant difference in income between two groups.

**Note:**
**Descriptive statistics** describes the data you have, while **inferential statistics** helps make predictions and inferences about a larger set of data based on a sample.
