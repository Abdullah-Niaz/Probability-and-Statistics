# Variable

Variable is a property that can take on many values(Singular Values).
Variable is a characteristic of a data point that can change.
Example: Height, Weight, Age, etc.

## Types of Variable:

### 1. Quantitative Vairiable(Numerical):

1. Discrete Variable
2. Continues Variable

### 2. Qualitative Variable/ Catagorial:

1. Nominal Variable
2. Ordinal Variable

## Quantitative Variable:

1.  Discrete Variable:

    A variable for which values can take are countable and finite not of possibilites. these values are often in integers.
    Ex: No Students in Classroom

    - Alwasy be a whole no. So, it will never be like 20.2 or 10.3 etc

2.  Continues Variable:

    A variable for which the values are not countable and have a infinite no of possibilites.
    Ex: Height, Weight, Age, etc.

## Qualitative / Catagorial Variable :

A variable where no ordering is possible or implaced in levels.

1. Nominal Variable:

   - Nominal varaibles are catagorial values that represent catagories or group with no order or ranking between then.
   - Ex: Gender, Color, etc.
   - No order or ranking between them.
   - No numerical value can be assigned to them.

2. Ordinal Variable:
   - Ordinal Variables are catagorial values that represent catagories or group with order or ranking between them.
   - Ex: Education Level (Elementroy, School, High school, College Graduate School), Speed Status(Low , middle , high).
